                Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard
                and
                sell your most personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has
                turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.

            <p>
                But fear not, for Pied Piper has the
                answer! And it’s simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by
                universal
                compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put even simpler — <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong>
